# SimulatingGaussians
Introduction:

Simulation is a very powerful tool that can be used to approximate real world results in a cost efficient and timely manner. Simulation is especially important in the field of statistics as it can simulate random variables and vectors and be used in different statistical methods and models. In this research I will use several different methods of simulating univariate and multivariate normal distributions and compare each method’s results in terms of quality and speed. 

Methodology:

I plan to survey literature in the field and implement widely used simulation methods. This will be done in a computer programming language (Python and/or R). From there I will use a variety of different tests to determine the efficacy and quality of the simulated variables/vectors produced from each method tested. The results will be visualized in charts and graphs and explained in the final paper.

Faculty Mentor:

I first learned about statistical simulation while taking M362M Intro to Stochastic Processes with Dr. Zitkovic last fall. Since Dr. Zitkovic is an expert in simulation and its applications, I thought that he would be the perfect mentor for this project. I also enjoy Dr. Zitkovic’s teaching style which will help me understand any new material I learn for this project.
